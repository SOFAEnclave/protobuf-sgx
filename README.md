# protobuf-sgx

Protobuf-sgx is forked from the [google protocolbuffers/protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
CPP code and has been modified for SGX enclave trusted code.

Now, protobuf-sgx is used by KubeTEE [trusted-function-framework](https://github.com/SOFAEnclave/trusted-function-framework)
